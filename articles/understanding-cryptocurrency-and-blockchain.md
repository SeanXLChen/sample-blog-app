# Understanding Cryptocurrency and Blockchain

Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have gained significant attention in recent years. But what exactly are they?

## What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. It operates independently of a central bank.

### Popular Cryptocurrencies

- **Bitcoin (BTC)**: The first and most widely known cryptocurrency.
- **Ethereum (ETH)**: Known for its smart contract functionality.
- **Ripple (XRP)**: Focuses on enabling real-time cross-border payments.

## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. It records transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively.

### Key Features of Blockchain

1. **Decentralization**: No single entity controls the entire blockchain.
2. **Transparency**: All transactions are publicly recorded and can be verified by anyone.
3. **Security**: Cryptographic techniques ensure the integrity of the data.

## The Future of Cryptocurrency
